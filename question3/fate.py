'''Write a Python program that calculates the factorial of a given integer. The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.

The program should prompt the user to enter a non-negative integer, and then calculate its factorial. The program should handle invalid input gracefully by displaying an error message and asking the user to enter a valid input.

Sample Output:
Enter a non-negative integer: 5
The factorial of 5 is 120.
